# KPLEX
This project includes the source code, test bed of instances and the complete experimental results of the paper "A Fast Algorithm to Compute Maximum k-Plexes in Social Network Analysis".

An instance of our test bed is a simple undirected graph, described with the following format:
$n m k$
$u_1 v_1$
$u_2 v_2$
...
$u_m v_m$
where $n$ is the number of the vertices, $m$ is the number of edges, $k$ is the parameter of the maximum-$k$-plex problem, and $u_i v_i$ indicates an edge of the graph.
